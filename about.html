        Since I was young I have been facinated by Space. It has always captivated me and given me the reason 
        to do well in school, and eventually pick my major as well. I love how Space is so vast, to the point where 
        it is mid blowing, and it makes us realize how small we are compared to the universe. I also love how every
        single thing connects to it, whether it be having the ability to communicate with others (using satellite 
        dishes) or the very atoms that make up our bodies.

          <h4 class="section-title">Why I love space</h4>

          <p>
            I love space because it feels endless and as if no matter how much you learn, there's always more to see. 
            It forces me to think bigger, motivates me to keep learning, and oddly enough makes me feel very connected to
            everything spiritually. I think Space is one of the biggest examples, of humanity coming together from all 
            over the world to tackle a subject in science where no one has the complete knowledge, and unites us in a 
            way that almost nothing can.

            I chose Geomatics Engineering to pursue my love for space and eventually be helping in creating technologies and 
            analyzing data that would expand our knowledge in this subject greatly!

        In the future, I want to keep learning more about space technology and how it connects to geomatics.
        I want to work on projects that use satellite data, navigation, and mapping in ways that actually help people.
